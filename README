**Library for use with Landtiger LPC-1768 board.**
This library has been developed as a support for students attending the courses "Computer Architectures" and "Architetture dei Sistemi di Elaborazione" at Politecnico di Torino.
## Mappings
The mappings used for buttons and leds in this project are:

	//Leds mapping:
	//	LED		PIN		NUM
	//	LD11 	p2.0	7
	//	LD10 	p2.1	6
	//	LD9  	p2.2	5
	//	LD8  	p2.3	4
	//	LD7  	p2.4	3
	//	LD6  	p2.5	2
	//	LD5  	p2.6	1
	//	LD4  	p2.7	0

	//Buttons mapping:
	//	BUTTON	PIN		INTERRUPT		INDEX
	//	INT0	p2.10	EINT0			0
	//	KEY1	p2.11	EINT1			1
	//	KEY2	p2.12	EINT2			2
## Leds
I added code for managing onboard leds, along with some useful functions. You can find those in lib_led.c, they are pretty mich self-explanatory.


## Dynamic Handlers
In order to use timer and button dynamic handling, you should add:

    init_timer_handlers(); // Initialize timer handlers
    init_button_handlers(); //Initialize button handlers

To your starting code.

An "handler" is a function defined as follows:

    void handler(int source_id){
	    [...]
	}

Where source_id represents the calling event, ie which button has been pressed.

## Debouncing Buttons
Button debouncing was implemented by the original library author by disabling following interrupts, I added another version using a debounce timer.
You can enable it by uncommenting USE_DEBOUNCE_TIMER definition in funct_button.c
